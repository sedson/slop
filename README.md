# Slop

Slop is a Lisp-based creative-coding tool. The two main parts of the project are a custom dialect of Lisp and a web-based environment to live-code graphics using that Lisp.

## Can I try it?

#### Online

Slop is – as of now – a personal exploration and a work in progress. If you *really* want to mess with Slop, a live version of the playground is available at [slop.seamus.website](https://slop.seamus.website) – though I definitely wouldn't call it "polished" or "easy to use" quite yet. There is a bare-bones [language reference](#language-reference) at the bottom of this readme.

#### Locally

Run a local server at the project root! Right now, Slop is all client-side ES6 modules. This is nice because there's no build step, but might not work across all browsers.

#### Keymap

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `Meta+Enter` | eval current script |
| `Meta+/` | comment/uncomment current selection or line |

where `Meta` is `Cmd` on MacOs and `Ctrl` elsewhere.

## More

This project started as a smallish idea about writing some sort of "S-expressions for compositing images DSL." Then things kept popping up like: "Well, if I can load and composite image files, it sure would be nice to be able to draw a circle into one of them, and it sure would be nice to position that circle using some math." This led me to create a full Lisp interpreter – which was a ton of fun. 

For me this project is about building a DIY, specific, personal tool that supports drawing and compositing procedural images with images-from-files.

Slop is *heavily* inspired by Hundred Rabbits' [Ronin]. Mary Rose Cook's [Little Lisp Interpreter](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter) was also a huge source of inspiration and help. Baku Hashimoto's [Glisp](https://glisp.app/commit:e7fbaae/) is an insanely cool Lisp for graphics.

# Language Reference 

### Lisp Core
```
(def symb value-expr)
  # Creates a binding: binds the result of evaluating value-expr to the symbol symb.
  # Cannot be reset with set.

(var symb value-expr)
  # Creates a variable binding: binds the result of evaluating value-expr to the symbol symb.
  # Can be reset with set.

(set symb value-expr)
  # Sets the value of an existing variable to the result of evaluating value-expr.
  # Can only be used on variables defined with var.
  # Note that a dict defined with def cannot have its properties altered with set.

(fn params & body)
  # Creates an anonymous function with the given params and body.
  # Returns a function object.

(fx & body)
  # Shorthand for creating a function with a single parameter 'x'.
  # Equivalent to (fn [x] & body).

(defn name params & body)
  # Defines a named function.
  # Combines def and fn to create and bind a function to the given name.

(macro params & body)
  # Creates a macro with the given params and body.
  # Returns a macro object.

(defmacro name params & body)
  # Defines a named macro.
  # Combines def and macro to create and bind a macro to the given name.

(let [bindings*] & body)
  # Creates a new lexical scope with the given bindings.
  # Evaluates the body in this new scope and returns the result of the last expression.

(do & exprs)
  # Evaluates expressions in order and returns the value of the last one.
  # Creates a new lexical scope.

(upscope & exprs)
  # Similar to do, but evaluates expressions in the current scope without creating a new one.

(for [var start end ?step] & body)
  # Iterates over a range of numbers, binding each to var in turn.
  # Evaluates body for each iteration.
  # Returns the result of the last evaluation of body.

(if predicate then-expr else-expr)
  # Evaluates predicate. If truthy, evaluates and returns then-expr, otherwise else-expr.

(cond & clauses)
  # Takes a set of test/expression pairs.
  # Evaluates each test one at a time until a truthy value is found, then evaluates and returns the corresponding expression.

(type expr)
  # Returns the type of the result of evaluating expr.

(symbol expr)
  # Converts the result of evaluating expr into a symbol.

(list & exprs)
  # Creates a list containing the results of evaluating the given expressions.

(vec & exprs)
  # Creates a vector containing the results of evaluating the given expressions.

(eval expr)
  # Evaluates expr twice: first to get a form, then evaluates that form.

(quote form)
  # Returns the unevaluated form.

(splice expr)
  # Evaluates expr and marks the result for splicing into a surrounding list or vector.

(quasi form)
  # Similar to quote, but allows selective evaluation using unquote and splice-unquote within the form.

(unquote expr)
  # Within a quasiquote, evaluates expr and inserts the result.

(splice-unquote expr)
  # Within a quasiquote, evaluates expr (which must yield a list) and splice
```

### Predicates
```
(nil? form)
  # Returns true if form is nil, false otherwise.

(num? form)
  # Returns true if form is a number, false otherwise.

  # Returns true if form is a list, false otherwise.

(dict? form)
  # Returns true if form is a dictionary, false otherwise.

(list-like? form)
  # Returns true if form is list-like (list or vector), false otherwise.

(fn? form)
  # Returns true if form is a function, false otherwise.

(key? form)
  # Returns true if form is a key, false otherwise.

(bool? form)
  # Returns true if form is a boolean, false otherwise.

(symbol? form)
  # Returns true if form is a symbol, false otherwise.

(string? form)
  # Returns true if form is a string, false otherwise.

# PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator)
(seed num)
  # Sets the seed for the pseudo-random number generator.

(rand)
  # Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.
```
